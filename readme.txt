1. If any questions just leave them in the discord server #help tab, please include above the question '--QUESTION--' to make it easier to tell what is a question or a general help message.

2. Do not change any of the file names (this can cause issues when: enabling, disabling, updating).

3. This will not give you any sort of virus, if you claim this will give you a virus we can provide proof therefore you should too.

4. Our custom commands/features will be listed in the #description section of the discord server: an update log & commands/features will be provided after every major update, and tiny patch fixes will be in #patches

5. If you feel suspicious of this give us a break and just don't install it, no need to say 'I think this may be a virus guys ðŸ¤“'.
