1. If any questions just leave them in the discord server #help tab, please include above the question '--QUESTION--' to make it easier to tell what is a question or a general help message.

2. Do not change any of the file names (this can cause issues when: enabling, disabling, updating).

3. This will not give you any sort of virus, if you claim this will give you a virus we can provide proof therefore you should too.

4. If you see any changes in your system32 file and feel spectical you can tell us and we will explain why and what they are there for.

5. Our custom commands/features will be listed in the #description section of the discord server: an update log & commands/features will be provided after every major update, and tiny patch fixes will be in #patches

6. If you feel suspicious of this give us a break and just don't install it, no need to say 'I think this may be a virus guys ðŸ¤“'.
